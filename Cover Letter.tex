I recently finished my studies in the US at Rutgers University majoring in Computer Science and am looking to start my career in Warsaw. 

During my studies I became intrigued by distributed systems and algorithms such as Hadoop MapReduce. It is clear to me that distributed systems are the foundation for revolutionary technologies, therefor I would like to build my career on DS software such as Hadoop.
