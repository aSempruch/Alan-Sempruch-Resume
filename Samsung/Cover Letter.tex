{\huge Cover Letter}
\vspace{0.25in}

I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Rutgers University, where I discovered that I am highly interested in artificial intelligence, specifically, natural language processing. In order to further develop my knowledge of NLP, I enrolled as a graduate student, with a focus on NLP, at Johns Hopkins University. I will be starting my studies September of 2020, which leaves with me with enough time to take part in this internship, and allow me to develop a better understanding of how NLP is utilized and developed at a company who is one of the leaders in technology. I believe this would greatly benefit my personal development in NLP

I am eager to hear back.
